    "For example, each image contains a  unique capture identifier.  Capture identifiers are shared between all 5 images captured by RedEdge at the same moment, and can be used to unambiguously group images in post processing, regardless of how the images are named or stored on disk.  Each image also contains a flight identifer which is the same for all images taken during a single power cycle of the camera.  This can be used in post-processing workflows to group images and in many cases, more easily identify when the vehicle took off and landed."

    "### Converting raw images to Radiance\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately most RedEdge users want to calibrate raw images from the camera into reflectance maps.  This can be done using off-the-shelf software from third parties, but you are here because there is no fun in that!  Along with this tutorial we have included some helper utilities that will handle much of this conversion for you, but here we will walk through a few of those functions to discuss what is happening inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any RedEdge workflow must include these common steps.\n",
    "1. Un-bias images by accounting for the dark pixel offset\n",
    "1. Compensate for imager-level effects\n",
    "1. Compensate for optical chain effects\n",
    "1. Normalize images by exposure and gain settings\n",
    "1. Convert to a common unit system (radiance)\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are handled by the `micasense.utils.raw_image_to_radiance(metadata, raw_image)` function.  Let us take a look at that fuction in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we get the darkPixel values. These values come from optically-covered pixels on the imager which are exposed at the same time as the image pixels. They measure the small amount of random charge generation in each pixel, independent of incoming light, which is common to all semiconductor imaging devices.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    blackLevel = np.array(meta.get_item('Exif.BlackLevel'))\n",
    "    darkLevel = blackLevel.mean()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, we get the imager-specific calibrations.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    a1, a2, a3 = meta.get_item('XMP:RadiometricCalibration')\n",
    "```\n",
    "We get the parameters of the optical chain (vignette) effects and create a vignette map. This map will be multiplied by the black-level corrected image values to reverse the darkening seen at the image corners.  See the `vignette_map` function for the details of the vignette parameters and their use.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    V, x, y = vignette_map(meta, xDim, yDim)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we can calculate the imager-specfic radiometric correction function, which help to account for the radiometric inaccuracies of the CMOS imager pixels.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # row gradient correction\n",
    "    R = 1.0 / (1.0 + a2 * y / exposureTime - a3 * y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, we apply these functions to the raw image to result in a corrected image\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # subtract the dark level and adjust for vignette and row gradient\n",
    "    L = V * R * (imageRaw - darkLevel)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, we get the exposure and gain settings (gain is represented in the photographic parameter ISO, with a base ISO of 100, so we divide the result to get a numeric gain).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    exposureTime = float(meta.get_item('EXIF:ExposureTime'))\n",
    "    gain = float(meta.get_item('EXIF:ISOSpeed'))/100.0 \n",
    "```\n",
    "Now that we have a corrected image, we can apply a conversion from calibrated digital number values to radiance units (W/m^2/nm/sr). Note that in this conversion, we need to normalize by the image bitdepth (2^16 for 16 bit images, 2^12 for 12-bit images), because the calibration coefficients are scaled to work with normalized input values.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # apply the radiometric calibration - \n",
    "    # scale by the gain-exposure product and multiply with the radiometric calibration coefficient\n",
    "    bitsPerPixel = meta.get_item('EXIF:BitsPerSample')\n",
    "    dnMax = float(2**bitsPerPixel)\n",
    "    radianceImage = L.astype(float)/(gain * exposureTime)*a1/dnMax\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    "For convenience, we have written the `raw_image_to_radiance` function to return the intermediate compensation images as well, so we can visualize them for the tutorial. These intermediate results are not required in most implementations and can be ommitted, if performance is a concern."

In fact, reflectances higher than 100% are normal in specific cases of [specular reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection). The panel area is a special material that reflects incident light equally well in all directions; however, some of the objects in a scene (especially man-made objects) instead reflect most incident light in one direction, more like a mirror.  An example is the reflection of the sun off of the smooth surface of a car or the reflection off of a body of water.\n",

The area should have a very consistent reflectance.

Based on the context of the image, it is also clear that the user is taking the panel image facing the sun, which can cast reflected light from the operator's clothing on the panel and contaminate results.

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we have found that we can read MicaSense RedEdge images and their metadata, and use python and OpenCV to convert those images to radiance and then to reflectance using the standard scientific field method of imaging a lambertian reflector.  We have corrected for both the electro-optical effects of the sensor and optical chain, as well as the incident light at the time of capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future tutorials, we will introduce the Downwelling Light Sensor (DLS) information into the calibration process in order to account for changing irradiance over time (e.g. such as clouds).  However, since the panel method is straightforward and repeatable under constant illumination conditions, and is the standard scientific calibration method of surface reflectance, this  process is useful and sufficient for many calibration needs.\n",
