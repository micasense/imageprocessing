    "# Tutorial 2 - MicaSense library\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you have gone through the [basic setup](./Micasense Image Processing Setup.html) and builds on the basic radiance, irradiance, and reflectance concepts and code covered in the [first tutorial](./MicaSense Image Processing Tutorial 1.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will cover usage of the MicaSense python library to access images and groups of images.  Most of the processing details are hidden away in the library, but the library code is open and available in the git repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Library Components\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first tutorial, we introduced `micasense.utils` which provided some helper functions for single image manipulation, and `micasense.plotutils` which provided some plotting helpers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this second tutorial, we are going to introduce the usage of the included micasense libraries for opening, converting, and displaying images. This will allow us to discuss and visualize results at a high level, while the underlying source code is available for those interested in the implementation details.  In some cases, the libraries themselves may be enough to implement a custom workflow without the need to re-implement or translate the code to another system or language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library code provides some basic classes to manage image data.  At the highest level is the `ImageSet`, which is able to load a list of files or recursively search a whole directory into data structures which are easy to access and manipulate.  `ImageSet`s are made up of `Capture`s, which hold the set of (usually 5) images as they are simultaneously gathered by the RedEdge camera.  Within `Capture`s are `Image`s, which hold a single image file and allow easy access to the image metadata.  The `Image` class also provides the ability to extract metadata from individual images and to convert individual images in similar ways to those described in the first tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of this article, we will look at each of the objects available starting with the single `Image` object, and work our way up to the whole `ImageSet`.  Each section in this article is standalone, and can be copied into another workbook or edited in place to explore more of the functions associated with that object."

    "An image is the lowest level object. It represents the data in a single tiff file as taken by the camera.  `Image` objects expose a set of data retrieval methods which provide access to raw, radiance, and reflectance corrected images, and to undistort any of those images. Note that when retrieving image data from an `Image` object, the data is stored internally in the object, increasing the object's memory footprint. If operating on a large number of images, it may be necessary to release this data memory after each image is processed to limit the program memory footprint. This can be done by calling the `Image.clear_image_data()` method."
