    "# MicaSense Image Processing Tutorials \n",
    "\n",
    "This repository includes tutorials and examples for processing MicaSense RedEdge-M/MX, Altum, RedEdge-P, and  Altum-PT images into usable information using the Python programming language.  The intended audience is researchers and engineers with some software development experience that want to do their own image processing.  While a number of commercial tools fully support processing MicaSense data into reflectance maps, there are a number of reasons to process your own data. This can include: controlling the entire radiometric workflow (for academic or publication reasons), pre-processing images to be used in a non-radiometric photogrammetry suite, or processing single sets of images (captures) without building a larger map.\n",
