    "# Active Image Alignment\n",
    "For most use cases, each band of a multispectral capture must be aligned with the other bands in order to create meaningful data. In this tutorial, we show how to align the band to each other using open source OpenCV utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image alignment allows the combination of images into true-color (RGB) and false color (such as CIR) composites, useful for scouting using single images as well as for display and management uses. In addition to composite images, alignment allows the calculation of pixel-accurate indices such as NDVI or NDRE at the single image level which can be very useful for applications like plant counting and coverage estimations, where mosaicing artifacts may otherwise skew analysis results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image alignment method described below tends to work well on images with abundant image features, or areas of significant contrast. Cars, buildings, parking lots, and roads tend to provide the best results. This approach may not work well on images which contain few features or very repetitive features, such as full canopy row crops or fields of repetitive small crops such lettuce or strawberries. We will disscuss more about the advantages and disadvantages of these methods below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions behind this alignment process can work with most versions of RedEdge and Altum firmware. They will work best with RedEdge (3,M,MX) versions above 3.2.0 which include the \"RigRelatives\" tags, and all RedEdge-P/Altum/Altum-PT imagery. These tags provide a starting point for the image transformation and can help to ensure convergence of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Opening Images\n",
    "As we have done in previous examples, we use the micasense.capture class to open, radiometrically correct, and visualize all the bands of a MicaSense capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll load the `autoreload` extension. This lets us change underlying code (such as library functions) without having to reload the entire workbook and kernel. This is useful in this workbook because the cell that runs the alignment can take a long time to run, so with the `autoreload` extension we can update the code after the alignment step for analysis and visualization without needing to re-compute the alignments each time."

Our experience shows that once a good alignment transformation is found, it tends to be stable over a flight and, in most cases, over many flights. The transformation may change if the camera undergoes a shock event (such as a hard landing or drop) or if the temperature changes substantially between flights. In these events, a new transformation may need to be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, since this approach finds a 2-dimensional (affine) transformation between images, it won't work when the parallax between bands results in a 3-dimensional depth field. This can happen if very close to the target or when targets are visible at significantly different ranges, such as a nearby tree or building against a background much farther way. In these cases, it will be necessary to use photogrammetry techniques to find a 3-dimensional mapping between images.\n",
    "\n",
    "For best alignment results it's good to select a capture which has features which visible in all bands. Man-made objects such as cars, roads, and buildings tend to work very well, while captures of only repeating crop rows tend to work poorly. Remember, once a good transformation has been found for flight, it can be generally be applied across all of the images.\n",

    "It's also good to use an image for alignment which is taken near the same level above ground as the rest of the flights. Above approximately 35m AGL, the alignment will be consistent. However, if images taken closer to the ground are used, such as panel images, the same alignment transformation will not work for the flight data."

To do this we use the affine transforms found above and the image distortions from the image metadata. OpenCV provides a couple of handy helpers for this task in the cv2.undistortPoints() and cv2.transform() methods. These methods take a set of pixel coordinates and apply our undistortion matrix and our affine transform, respectively. So, just as we did when registering the images, we first apply the undistortion process to the coordinates of the image borders, then we apply the affine transformation to that result. The resulting pixel coordinates tell us where the image borders end up after this pair of transformations, and we can then crop the resultant image to these coordinates."
